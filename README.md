# VanillaProject

**VanillaProject** is a clean, modular Java backend starter template built with Spring Boot and Maven. It emphasizes best practices such as layer separation, modularity, and readability ‚Äî making it simple for any backend developer to understand, maintain, and scale.

This project is designed as a solid foundation for enterprise-grade backend applications. By clearly separating concerns into dedicated layers and Maven modules, VanillaProject enables developers to build scalable, maintainable, and testable systems with ease.

## Key Highlights

- **Layered Architecture:** Each module corresponds to a logical layer ‚Äî from data access (`vanilla_persistence`), business logic (`vanilla_business`), to API controllers (`vanilla_presentation`).
- **Frontend Integration:** The `vanilla_web` module contains the frontend application built with modern frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, providing a responsive UI that seamlessly interacts with backend APIs.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Avoids monolithic structures by distributing responsibilities cleanly, enhancing maintainability and collaboration.
- **Extensibility:** Easily extendable with workflow components (`vanilla_workflow`), reusable utilities (`vanilla_common`), and comprehensive tests (`vanilla_junit`).
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Spring Boot and Maven, offering a robust and tested foundation for rapid development.

VanillaProject is ideal for teams and individual developers seeking a **well-organized**, **scalable**, and **easy-to-understand** project structure that encourages clean code and effective collaboration.

## üìñ Project Philosophy

VanillaProject rejects the clutter of stuffing all code into a single package. Instead, it organizes logic into clearly defined layers and Maven modules to ensure:

- ‚úÖ Easier maintenance  
- ‚úÖ Faster onboarding for new developers  
- ‚úÖ Greater scalability and testability  
- ‚úÖ Cleaner, more professional code organization  

This approach aligns with **clean architecture** principles and is especially beneficial for team projects and long-term codebases.
